<!-- bio -->
My name is Ashlee Culmsee (they/she) and I'm a 23 year old nonbinary woman working with the Power Platform as a senior developer and trainer.

In three years, I went from a teenager with severe social anxiety and no interest in IT to an internationally-recognized app developer who creates cost-saving apps for household names.

At the age of 18, my dad convinced me to try out Power Apps and I found a love for technology after winning Microsoft’s ‘Fidget Spinner’ app challenge, despite having no prior IT experience. I went on to develop the Universal Audit App with my dad, which has streamlined auditing processes across multiple industries and has been deployed across the world.

At 20, I became the youngest woman ever to have been recognised with a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) Award.

Today, I work full time as a Power Platform dev and also run free workshops and events in partnership with businesses, schools and universities. I am a passionate mental health advocate and am determined to empower young minorities to pursue a career in technology.
